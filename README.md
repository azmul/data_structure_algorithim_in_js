   - Draw it
   - Create the API/operations method
2. Build the data structure
   - Pseudocode the implementation
   - Code the data structure constructor
3. Utilize the data strucute
   - Put your data structure to work
   - Pair it with an algorithm if needed
4. Understand the data structure
   - What is the time complexity?
   - How can you optimize?
